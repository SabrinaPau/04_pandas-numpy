    "You'll walk through instantiating a `DataFrame`, reading data into it, looking at and examining that data, and then playing with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset on the [quality of red wines](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) is used for this purpose.\n",
    "It is lokated in the `data` folder within this directory. It's called `winequality-red.csv`. \n",

    "Today, as we'll be playing around with `Pandas`, much of what we'll be doing is considered EDA. Therefore, by using a notebook, we'll get a tighter feedback loop with our work than we would trying to write a script. But, in general, **we do not use Jupyter notebooks for development**. \n",

    "You will instantiate a `DataFrame`, read data into it, explore that data and play with it. \n",

    "A dataset on the [quality of red wines](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) is used for this purpose.\n",

    "    * Importing Pandas\n",
    "    * Reading data into the DataFrame\n",
    "    * Getting a general sense of the data\n",

    "    * How many rows and columns are in the DataFrame?\n",
    "    * What data type is in each column?\n",
    "    * Are all of the variables continuous, or are any categorical?\n",
    "    * How many non-null values are in each column?\n",

If you'd like some extra practice, try answering each of the questions in more than one way (because remember, we can often grab our data in a couple of different ways). Grabbing is the same as displaying on the screen in this context.\n",

    "4. Grab all rows where the `chlorides` value is less than 0.10. \n",
    "5. Now grab all the rows where the `chlorides` value is greater than the column's mean (try **not** to use a hard-coded value for the mean, but instead a method).\n",
    "6. Grab all those rows where the `pH` is greater than 3.0 and less than 3.5. Further filter the results from 6 to grab only those rows that have a `residual sugar` less than 2.0. "

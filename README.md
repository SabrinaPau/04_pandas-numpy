In this Repository you can find Jupyter Notebooks that you should work on together as **Pair-Programmers**.

Please make sure you have **forked** the repo and set up a new virtual environment.

For this purpose you use following commands:

```Bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The added [requirements file](requirements.txt) contains all libraries and dependencies we need to execute Pandas and Numpy. 

At the end of this repo you should 
- understand why Pandas and Numpy are valuable tools for Data Scientists
- be familiar to handle data in Pandas DataFrames and Numpy-Arrays
- know how to combine datasets
- be able to do some EDA on a new dataset
- know how to plot some basic plots for better data understanding

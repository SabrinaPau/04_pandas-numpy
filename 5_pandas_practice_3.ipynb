    "As a data scientist, you don't always have to invent the wheel from scratch. The great advantage of Python is that smart people before you spend a lot of energy on making life easier for the next programers. So please, make your life easier and use code that has already been implemented, don't call it \"copying\" but \"friendly borrowing\" of other people's code. If you copy whole functions or great graphs in the future, don't forget to give props to the inventor!\n",

    "So for this exercise, too, if you get stuck at any point, look at good solutions from others and learn a lot from them about how to solve these problems even better.\n",
    "Here are two good resources for small code snippet which can be very helpful when dealing with DataFrames:\n",
